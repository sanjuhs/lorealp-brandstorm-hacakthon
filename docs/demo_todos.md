So here are the things that I should do one by one.

1. Take a few pictures of myself in different poses for the theoretical way in which the users will take photos and populate the feed.
2. Umm... Maybe check the functionality of create a new post.
3. Add three different options for create a new post and then check if that works.
4. Add a file AI API call so that I can do image editing if possible.
5. build out the three different ways of adding photos so that we can create a new feed posts etc etc
6. Populate the profile page and check if that works.
7. Create a discount page with offers and so on for so and forth so that that can also work

8. Build out AI feature within Create/Analyze Post first and make sure only that works properly first

Man, I really want to make the whole thing work and make it live. Basically I also want to add the postgres database and I want to add a bunch of other stuff and make it proper.
